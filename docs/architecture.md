- **Dynamic Secrets**: Support for dynamic database credentials and API key rotation.
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all secret access and modifications.
- **Integration**: Native integration with PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and other infrastructure components.
- **Policy-based Access**: Fine-grained access control policies for different application components.

### Implementation
- **Vault cluster** with PostgreSQL backend, integrated with application services for dynamic secret retrieval.
- **Periodic polling** mechanism for automatic configuration updates:
  - Default 24-hour poll interval (configurable via `VAULT_POLL_INTERVAL`)
  - Version-based change detection to avoid redundant reloads
  - Automatic reload when a secret version changes in Vault
  - Combined with signal-based manual reload (SIGHUP) for immediate updates
- **Authentication methods**: Support for token-based and AppRole authentication
- **Secret versioning**: Tracks Vault secret versions to detect and apply changes

### Configuration Reload Strategy
1. **Automatic Periodic Polling**: Background ticker polls Vault at configured intervals
2. **Version Comparison**: Compares the current secret version with the last loaded version
3. **Conditional Reload**: Only reloads configuration when version changes are detected
4. **Manual Override**: SIGHUP signal triggers immediate reload regardless of version
5. **Error Handling**: Non-blocking error reporting via a dedicated error channel

### Consequences

- **Maintainability**: Clean code principles with early returns and minimal nesting

### Implementation
- **Ports**: Interface definitions in `internal/ports/` for repositories, services, and handlers
- **Adapters**: Concrete implementations in `internal/adapters/` for infrastructure components
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic in `internal/domain/` without external dependencies
- **CQRS**: Separate command and query handlers in `internal/usecases/`
- **Decorators**: Cross-cutting concerns in `internal/shared/decorators/`
- **Repository Pattern**: Multiple implementations (PostgreSQL, KeyDB, Vault)

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Highly testable, maintainable, flexible, clear separation of concerns
- **Negative**: More boilerplate code, steeper learning curve for new developers
- **Trade-off**: Increased initial complexity for long-term maintainability gains

## ADR-013: Content Hash Deduplication

**Context**: Web pages may be analyzed multiple times with identical content, leading to unnecessary processing and storage costs.

### Decision
Implement SHA-256 hash-based content deduplication to detect and avoid reanalyzing identical page content.

### Rationale

- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces storage requirements by reusing existing analysis results
- **Resource Optimization**: Saves bandwidth and processing time for identical content
- **User Experience**: Faster response times when content hasn't changed
- **Data Integrity**: SHA-256 provides reliable content fingerprinting with minimal collision risk

### Implementation
- **Database Schema**: `content_hash` column (VARCHAR 64) in the analysis table for storing SHA-256 hashes
- **Indexing**: Dedicated index `idx_analysis_content_hash` for efficient hash lookups
- **URL Normalization**: Combined with `url_normalized` for effective deduplication
- **Hash Computation**: SHA-256 hash calculated from fetched page content before analysis
- **Lookup Strategy**: Check for existing hash before processing new analysis requests

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Significant performance improvement for repeat analyses, reduced storage costs, faster user responses
- **Negative**: Additional hash computation overhead, potential edge cases with dynamic content
- **Trade-off**: Slight computational cost for hashing balanced by major savings in analysis processing

## ADR-014: Resilience and Fallback Mechanisms

**Context**: Real-time features and dynamic configuration updates may fail due to network issues, service unavailability, or infrastructure problems, requiring graceful degradation.

### Decision
Implement polling-based fallback mechanisms for both frontend real-time updates and backend configuration management to ensure system resilience.

### Rationale
- **Reliability**: Ensures functionality even when preferred mechanisms (SSE, Vault) are unavailable
- **User Experience**: Maintains seamless operation without user-visible failures
- **Operational Flexibility**: Allows system to operate with degraded infrastructure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback to alternative mechanisms without manual intervention
- **Zero Downtime**: Configuration updates and status monitoring continue during partial failures

### Implementation

#### Frontend Polling Fallback (Real-time Updates)
- **Primary Mechanism**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time analysis progress
- **Fallback Strategy**: Automatic polling when SSE connection fails or is unavailable
- **Trigger Conditions**: SSE connection errors, timeout failures, or unsupported environments
- **Polling Interval**: Configurable interval (default: every few seconds)
- **Seamless Transition**: Transparent fallback without user interaction required

#### Backend Polling Strategy (Configuration Updates)
- **Primary Mechanism**: Vault-based configuration with periodic polling
- **Default Poll Interval**: 24 hours (configurable via `VAULT_POLL_INTERVAL`)
- **Version-based Detection**: Only reloads when Vault secret version changes
- **Manual Override**: SIGHUP signal for immediate reload regardless of schedule
- **Error Handling**: Non-blocking error reporting continues operation during Vault unavailability

### Consequences
